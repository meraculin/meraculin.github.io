Hi there! I finally have some spare time (Fall Break at UM) to write and share a story, so let me introduce myself first. My name is Sam Husna; I'm Indonesian and used to live and study in Japan for six years for undergrad and master's. I speak three languages: Indonesian, English, and Japanese. I just moved to the US for my PhD in Chemistry at the University of Michigan in August 2025, and because the situation around world is sorta weird right now, I thought it was a good time to share my journey to get here.

In this post I'm sharing my rationale for moving here, what the situation was at the time, and why it made sense for me to move based on my situation, so this will be a summary of the past two years (2024-2025)
