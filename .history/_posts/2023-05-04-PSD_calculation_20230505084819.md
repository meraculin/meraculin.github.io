Beads or droplets trapped in the optical trap are subjected to the viscous resistance of the solution and the elastic force of the optical trap. Furthermore, if the external force is expressed as $$ F(t) $$, the equation of motion of the beads is given by the Langevin equation:

$$
\gamma\ \frac{dx(t)}{dt}+Kx(t) = F(t)
$$

The $$ \gamma $$ viscosity is represented by $$ \gamma $$ viscous resistance and $$ K $$ is the stiffness constant. In this equation, the external force $$ F(t) $$ is the random force that drives the Brownian motion of the beads.
The stochastic process of this force is a stationary Gaussian process with zero mean value. Therefore, taking the average of the Brownian motion of the beads, we obtain:

$$
\langle F(t) \rangle = 0
$$

and

$$
\gamma\ \frac{dx(t)}{dt}+K\langle x \rangle = 0.
$$

From this solution, the relaxation time of the bead motion, $$ \tau _0 $$ can be expressed as:

$$
\tau_0= \frac{\gamma}{K}
$$

Also, at this time, from Boltzmann's Equipartition theorem

$$
\frac{1}{2}k_B T = \frac{1}{2}\langle x^2 \rangle 
$$

We now consider the autocorrelation function and the power spectral density. In this case, the autocorrelation function $$ C_{xx} $$ is expressed as,

$$
C_{xx}=\langle x^2 \rangle e^{-\frac{\tau}{\tau_0}}
$$

Also, from the Winner-Hinchin theorem, we know that the autocorrelation function and the PSD $$ \phi (w) $$  can be connected by a Fourier function, so we can use the following equation to calculate the power spectral density,

$$
\phi (\omega)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}C_{xx}(\tau)e^{i\omega t}d\tau
$$

Substituting the autocorrelation function for the calculation,

$$
\phi (\omega)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\langle x^2 \rangle \tau_0}{1+(\tau_0\omega ^2)}
$$

Rewriting the angular velocity $$ \omega $$  in terms of frequency $$ f $$,

$$
\phi (f)=\frac{\frac{2k_bT\gamma}{K}}{1+(\frac{2\tau f\gamma}{K})^2}
$$

where $$ \phi(0) $$ at $$ f = 0 $$ and the corner frequency $$ f_c $$

$$
\phi(0)=\frac{2k_BT\gamma}{K}, \ \ \ \ \ f_c=\frac{K}{2\pi\gamma}
$$

Then, we can find that

$$
\phi(f)=\frac{\phi(0)}{1+(\frac{f}{f_c})^2}
$$

If we integral,

$$
\int^\infty_0\phi(f)df=\int^\infty_0\frac{\phi(0)}{1+(\frac{f}{f_c})^2}df=[\arctan(\frac{f}{f_c})]^{\infty}_0=\frac{\pi\phi(0)f_c}{2}
$$

Since this is equal to the displacement variance $$ \langle x^2\rangle $$,
From Equal Energy Distribution Law:

$$
\frac{1}{2}k_bT=\frac{1}{2}K\langle x^2\rangle
$$

Then,

$$
K = \frac{k_BT}{\langle x^2 \rangle} = \frac{2k_BT}{\pi\phi(0)f_c}
$$

Thus, from the power spectral density, $$ f_c $$ (Hz) and $\phi(0)$ (nm2 /Hz) by estimating from experimental results the trap elastic modulus $K$ can be calculated.
