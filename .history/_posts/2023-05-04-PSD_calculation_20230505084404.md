Beads or droplets trapped in the optical trap are subjected to the viscous resistance of the solution and the elastic force of the optical trap. Furthermore, if the external force is expressed as $$ F(t) $$, the equation of motion of the beads is given by the Langevin equation:

$$
\gamma\ \frac{dx(t)}{dt}+Kx(t) = F(t)
$$

The $$ \gamma $$ viscosity is represented by $$ \gamma $$ viscous resistance and $$ K $$ is the stiffness constant. In this equation, the external force $$ F(t) $$ is the random force that drives the Brownian motion of the beads.
The stochastic process of this force is a stationary Gaussian process with zero mean value. Therefore, taking the average of the Brownian motion of the beads, we obtain:

$$
\langle F(t) \rangle = 0
$$

and

$$
\gamma\ \frac{dx(t)}{dt}+K\langle x \rangle = 0.
$$

From this solution, the relaxation time of the bead motion, $$ \tau _0 $$ can be expressed as:

$$
\tau_0= \frac{\gamma}{K}
$$

Also, at this time, from Boltzmann's Equipartition theorem

$$
\frac{1}{2}k_B T = \frac{1}{2}\langle x^2 \rangle 
$$

We now consider the autocorrelation function and the power spectral density. In this case, the autocorrelation function $C_{xx}$ is expressed as,
$$
C_{xx}=\langle x^2 \rangle e^{-\frac{\tau}{\tau_0}}
$$
