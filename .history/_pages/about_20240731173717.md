Growing up, I had a bit too much fascination with fire, which naturally led me to discover my passion for chemistry. 

In undergrad, I completed my thesis on the topic of FUS droplet coalescence mechanism and currently continuing the same project in my masters. My research interest lies in the physics governing the droplet interface, particularly the amino acid residues that dictate these interactions.

I am currently using Python for most of my analysis and also at my part time job as an automation engineer.
