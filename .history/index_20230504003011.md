I've always been curious as a kid, exploring my backyard and experimenting on things. I tested the effects of colored light on oxygen production for my JHS graduation project. In HS, I joined the Chemistry team and competed in various olympiads. Now, I'm studying in vitro liquid-liquid phase phenomenon in FUS proteins at Tohoku University for my undergraduate thesis. Other than that, I am currently working with other students in the university to restart activity in one of the international student body.

Currently, I'm mostly using Python for my research, but I am also interested in learning more about R in graduate school.
