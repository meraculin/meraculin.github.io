Hi there! I finally have some spare time (Fall Break at UM) to write and share a story, so let me introduce myself first. My name is Sam Husna; I'm Indonesian and used to live and study in Japan for six years for undergrad and master's. I speak three languages: Indonesian, English, and Japanese. I just moved to the US for my PhD in Chemistry at the University of Michigan in August 2025, and because the situation around world is sorta weird right now, I thought it was a good time to share my journey to get here.

In this post I'm sharing my rationale for moving here, 

In this post I’m sharing what surprised me, what actually helped, and a few things I wish I’d known earlier—from visas and banking to housing, phones, and day-to-day life. If you’re planning a similar move, I hope this makes the transition feel more manageable (and a little less overwhelming).
