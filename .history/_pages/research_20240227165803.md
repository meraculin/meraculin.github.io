## Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
![LLPS](/assets/images/research/research_LLPS_1.png)

Dynamic droplets of FUS form and grow via fusions through cation-pi and electrostatic interactions. This process of LLPS is crucial for FUS proteins, facilitating cellular processes such as transcription and repair, by allowing individual proteins to aggregate into functional structures. I am interested in elucidating the molecular processes of coalescence in FUS droplets.
