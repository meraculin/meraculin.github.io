Fall Break at Michigan finally gave me a quiet moment to reflect on a big chapter: moving from Japan to the U.S. for my PhD.
Hi there!

In this post I’m sharing what surprised me, what actually helped, and a few things I wish I’d known earlier—from visas and banking to housing, phones, and day-to-day life. If you’re planning a similar move, I hope this makes the transition feel more manageable (and a little less overwhelming).
