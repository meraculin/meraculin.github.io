Hi there! I finally have some spare time (Fall break of the semester at UM) to write a story to share, so let me introduce myself first! My name is Sam Husna, I'm Indonesian who used to live and study in Japan for my undergrad and master's. I speak three languages: Indonesian, English, and Japanese. I just moved to the US for my PhD in Chemistry at the University of Michigan 

In this post I’m sharing what surprised me, what actually helped, and a few things I wish I’d known earlier—from visas and banking to housing, phones, and day-to-day life. If you’re planning a similar move, I hope this makes the transition feel more manageable (and a little less overwhelming).
