Growing up, I had a bit too much fascination with fire, which naturally led me to discover my passion for chemistry. As a chemist, I'm currently researching the liquid-liquid phase separation phenomenon (LLPS) of FUS proteins at Tohoku University. Mostly, I am using Python for my research, but I am also interested in learning more about R in graduate school.

Other than that, I like to read Korean manga and going out with friends.
