For my undergraduate thesis, I joined Biomolecular Dynamics Laboratory (Takahashi laboratory) under the guidance of Professor Kamagata.
My research project is about a phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation, where proteins submerged in solution under macromolecular crowding conditions phase separate into dilute and dense phase, called liquid droplet. 

I work with FUS proteins which aggregation is thought to cause the <a href = "https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als">ALS disease</a>. Recent research shows that these aggregate formations undergo a phase separated intermediate, which means that if we could develop a technique to control this phase separation phenomenon, we can come up with ways to treat the disease effectively. My research is about finding the physical property of liquid droplets formed by FUS proteins, specifically about the movement of molecules when two droplets fuse together into a singular bigger droplet and the changes on the surface of the droplets.

To do that, I use a combination of optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy to observe the collision and fusion processes of the droplets.
In this post, I will explain how we can calculate the force acted upon the droplets by the optical tweezers.

### Optical Tweezers Theory
Optical tweezers uses highly focused laser beam to hold and move microscopic objects depending on the refrative index of the particle and the surrounding medium.
The droplet trapped by the laser will oscillate due to Brownian motion caused by the thermal fluctations in the medium. In turn, the system can be thought of as a spring and we can calculate the force acting upon the droplet as a product of the spring constant and displacement.
The experiment scheme looks like this:

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/OT scheme.png" class="mx-auto d-block" %}
</div>
<div class="caption">
    <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Experiment scheme of droplets trapped by optical tweezers
</div>

To get this spring constant, we can use the power spectrum analysis of the position of the trapped droplet, which is usually considered to be the most reliable option.
We used a high speed camera to capture the position of the trapped droplet and determine its center using 'Analyze Particle' function on <a href = "https://imagej.net/imaging/particle-analysis">ImageJ</a>.

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

Then, we applied a  <a href = "https://imagej.net/imaging/particle-analysis">ImageJ</a>
