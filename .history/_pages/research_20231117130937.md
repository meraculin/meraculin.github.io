#### Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
![LLPS](/assets/images/research/research_LLPS_1.png)

 These droplets, formed through interactions such as cation-pi and electrostatic forces, are dynamic and can grow through mechanisms like fusion, where they coalesce to form larger droplets. The LLPS of FUS proteins is essential for their role in cellular functions including transcription, translation, and DNA repair. The accompanying figure illustrates the stages of LLPS, starting with individual FUS proteins, which aggregate into small droplets that eventually merge into larger, complex structures necessary for biological function.
