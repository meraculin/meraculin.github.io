Today, I am finally doing my first journal club after joining my laboratory in Tohoku University. My research is about biomolecular condensates, so when I first read the title of the article, I thought it would be interesting to cover. The article can be found here <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01252-8">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01252-8</a>.

### Main Idea
Biomolecular condensates, such as P granules and stress granules, play a critical role in the regulation of cell behaviors. The formation of condensates can be driven by phase separation coupled to percolation of intrinsically disordered protein (IDPs). Condensates can selectively enrich or exclude biomolecules, thereby enabling dynamic control over cellular processes.

Synthetic condensates built by naturally occurring IDPs fused with functional domains have been used to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-019-0284-8">control cell proliferation</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-019-0284-8">reassign codons of selected mRNAs</a> and control metabolic flow.
