#### Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
![LLPS](/assets/images/research/research_LLPS_1.png)

Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) is a fundamental process in cellular biology, where a homogenous solution separates into two distinct liquid phases. This separation is akin to oil droplets coalescing in water. In the context of proteins like FUS, LLPS allows these multifunctional molecules to transition from a dispersed state to condensed droplets. These droplets, formed through interactions such as cation-pi and electrostatic forces, are dynamic and can grow through mechanisms like fusion, where they coalesce to form larger droplets. The LLPS of FUS proteins is essential for their role in cellular functions including transcription, translation, and DNA repair. The accompanying figure illustrates the stages of LLPS, starting with individual FUS proteins, which aggregate into small droplets that eventually merge into larger, complex structures necessary for biological function.
