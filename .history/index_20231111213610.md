Growing up, I had a bit too much fascination with fire, which naturally led me to discover my passion for chemistry. I'm currently researching the liquid-liquid phase separation phenomenon (LLPS) of FUS proteins at Tohoku University. Mostly, I am using Python for my research, but I am also interested in learning more about R and LAMMPS/GROMACS in graduate school.
