Today, I am finally did my first journal club after joining my laboratory in Tohoku University. My research is about biomolecular condensates, so when I first read the title of the article, I thought it would be interesting to cover. The article can be found here <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01252-8">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01252-8</a>.

### Main Idea
Biomolecular condensates, such as P granules and stress granules, play a critical role in the regulation of cell behaviors. The formation of condensates can be driven by phase separation coupled to percolation (PSCP) of intrinsically disordered protein (IDPs). Condensates can selectively enrich or exclude biomolecules, thereby enabling dynamic control over cellular processes.

Synthetic condensates built by naturally occurring IDPs fused with functional domains have been used to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-021-00840-4">control cell proliferation</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw2644">reassign codons of selected mRNAs</a>,  and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-019-0284-8">control metabolic flow</a>.

Here, the authors demonstrate engineering of functional biomoecular condensates by leveraging the rules that have emerged from studies that have uncovered the driving forces for PSCP. They use these rules to construct fusions of synIDPs and functional domains to modulate the formation and physical properties of condensates and then perform condensate-mediated cellular functions in bacteria and mammalian cells.

### Engineering strategies for synthetic condensates

The authors selected a class of zwitterionic synIDPs, relisin-like polypeptides (RLP) that are inspired by <em> Drosophila melanogaster </em>Rec-1 resilin protein. The RLPs provide homotypic interactions that drive condensate formation. Each RLP consists of a repeating octapeptide, and the RLP with the GRGDSPYS repeat unit is designated as the wild type.

They are using a DNA-binding protein
