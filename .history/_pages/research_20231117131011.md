#### Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
![LLPS](/assets/images/research/research_LLPS_1.png)

Through cation-pi and electrostatic interactions, dynamic droplets form and grow via fusion, as illustrated in the figure. This process of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) is crucial for FUS proteins, facilitating cellular processes such as transcription and repair, by allowing individual proteins to aggregate into functional structures.
