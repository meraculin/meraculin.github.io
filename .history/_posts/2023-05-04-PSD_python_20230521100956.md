I work with FUS proteins which aggregation is thought to cause the <a href = "https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als">ALS disease</a>. Recent research shows that these aggregate formations undergo a phase separated intermediate, which means that if we could develop a technique to control this phase separation phenomenon, we can come up with ways to treat the disease effectively. My research is focuses on the physical properties of liquid droplets formed by FUS proteins, specifically about the movement of molecules when two droplets fuse together into a singular bigger droplet and the changes on the surface of the droplets.

To do that, I use a combination of optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy to observe the collision and fusion processes of the droplets.
In this post, I will explain how we can calculate the force acted upon the droplets by the optical tweezers using Python. In particular, we wanted to know if there is any correlation between the radius of the droplets and the spring constant.


### Optical Tweezers Theory
----------------------------------------------------------------
Optical tweezers uses highly focused laser beam to hold and move microscopic objects depending on the refrative index of the particle and the surrounding medium.
The droplet trapped by the laser will oscillate due to Brownian motion caused by the thermal fluctations in the medium. In turn, the system can be thought of as a spring and we can calculate the force acting upon the droplet as a product of the spring constant and displacement.
The experiment scheme looks like this:

The theory behind PSD calculation is described here by OptoSigma (in Japanese), <a href = "{{site.url}}/assets/pdf/OptoSigma Theory.pdf">pdf</a>.

### Method
----------------------------------------------------------------
To get this spring constant, we can use the power spectral density () analysis of the position of the trapped droplet, which is usually considered to be the most reliable option.
We used a high speed camera to capture the position of the trapped droplet and determine its center using 'Analyze Particle' function on <a href = "https://imagej.net/imaging/particle-analysis">ImageJ</a>.

ImageJ code:
```imageJ
macro "Analyze droplet" {
	name = getInfo("image.filename");
	name = replace(name, ".avi", "");
	filePath = "/Users/samm/Documents/Coding/Research/PSD/data/analyze_particle/"
	String.copy(name);
	run("Set Measurements...", "centroid center redirect=None decimal=3");
	run("Clear Results");
	run("Analyze Particles...", "size=750-Infinity circularity=0.60-1.00 display clear include add stack");
	updateResults;
	saveAs("Measurements", filePath+name+".txt");
}
```
Python code to generate the graph to show the position of the trapped droplet:
```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Name of the file containing the target data
filename = '20230510_142330'

# Path to the file containing the target data (from analyze particle function)
filepath = f"data/analyze_particle/{filename}.txt"

# Path for the output file
result_img = f"result/img/{filename}.png"
result_txt= f"result/txt/{filename}.txt"

# Conversion from camera pixel to micrometers and nanometers
pixel_to_micro = 0.048
pixel_to_nano = 48

# Load data from imageJ
with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
    time_val, x_val, y_val = [], [], []
    header = file.readline().strip().split('\t')
    for line in file:
        values = line.strip().split('\t')
        time_val.append(float(values[0]))
        x_val.append(float(values[3]))
        y_val.append(float(values[4]))

# Change the arrays into numpy arrays
time_val, x_val, y_val = np.array(time_val), np.array(x_val), np.array(y_val)

plt.figure(figsize=(5,5))
plt.plot(x_val, y_val, 'o', label='Position')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("X position")
plt.ylabel("Y position")
```
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/OT scheme.png" class="mx-auto d-block" %}

Then, now we can apply <a href = "https://imagej.net/imaging/particle-analysis">signal.welch</a> function from Scipy to get the power spectrum (nm<sup>2</sup>) of the droplets. The video is taken in 800 FPS, so the Nyquist frequency (bandwidth) is 800 Hz.
We also need to divide the resulting power spectral density by the bandwidth to get the power spectral density. The code we used and the resulting graph are described below.

```python
from scipy import signal
video_FPS = 800
freqs, psd = signal.welch(window='hann',x= norm_x, nperseg = 1024, scaling= 'density')

freqs *= 2 * video_FPS
psd /= video_FPS

print("Length of PSD:", len(freqs))
print("Largest PSD value:", np.max(psd))

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))
plt.semilogx(freqs, psd)
plt.yscale("log")
plt.xscale("log")
plt.ylim(10e-6)
plt.xlim(np.min(freqs))
plt.title('PSD: power spectral density (X)')
plt.xlabel('Frequency')
plt.ylabel('Power')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/OT scheme.png" class="mx-auto d-block" %}
</div>
<div class="caption">
    <strong>Figure 2.</strong> Power spectral density of the droplets against frequency
</div>

The power spectral density of the position of a trapped particle has a characteristic Lorentzian shape when the bead is held in a harmonic potential well:

$$
\phi(f) = \frac{\phi _{0}}{1+\frac{f}{f_{0}}}
$$

We can obtain the spring constant of a trapped droplet by using the following formula:

$$
k = \frac{2k_{B}T}{\pi\phi _{0}f_{c}}
$$

Then, we can fit a Lorentzian function on the PSD vs frequency graph to obtain the required parameters to get the desired spring constant.

Python code:
```python
from scipy import signal
video_FPS = 800
freqs, psd = signal.welch(window='hann',x= norm_x, nperseg = 1024, scaling= 'density')

freqs *= 2 * video_FPS
psd /= video_FPS

print("Length of PSD:", len(freqs))
print("Largest PSD value:", np.max(psd))

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))
plt.semilogx(freqs, psd)
plt.yscale("log")
plt.xscale("log")
plt.ylim(10e-6)
plt.xlim(np.min(freqs))
plt.title('PSD: power spectral density (X)')
plt.xlabel('Frequency')
plt.ylabel('Power')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
