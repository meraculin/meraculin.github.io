Today, I am finally doing my first journal club after joining my laboratory in Tohoku University. My research is about biomolecular condensates, so when I first read the title of the article, I thought it would be interesting to cover. The article can be found here <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01252-8">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01252-8</a>.
