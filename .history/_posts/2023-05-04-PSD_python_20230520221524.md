For my undergraduate thesis, I joined Biomolecular Dynamics Laboratory (Takahashi laboratory) under the guidance of Professor Kamagata.
My research project is about a phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation, where proteins submerged in solution under macromolecular crowding conditions phase separate into dilute and dense phase, called liquid droplet. I work with FUS proteins which aggregation is thought to cause the ALS disease. Recent research shows that these aggregate formations undergo a phase separated intermediate, which means that if we could develop a technique to control this phase separation phenomenon, we can come up with ways to treat the disease effectively. My research is about finding the physical property of liquid droplets formed by FUS proteins, specifically about the movement of molecules when two droplets fuse together into a singular bigger droplet and the changes on the surface of the droplets.

To do that, I use a combination of optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy to observe the collision and fusion processes of the droplets.
