Hi there! I finally have some spare time (Fall Break at UM) to write and share a story, so let me introduce myself first. My name is Sam Husna; I'm Indonesian and used to live and study in Japan for six years for undergrad and master's. I speak three languages: Indonesian, English, and Japanese. I just moved to the US for my PhD in Chemistry at the University of Michigan in August 2025, and because the situation around world is sorta weird right now, I thought it was a good time to share my journey to get here.

In this post I'm sharing my rationale for moving here, what the situation was at the time, and tips for choosing a country to do a PhD, in chronological order.
