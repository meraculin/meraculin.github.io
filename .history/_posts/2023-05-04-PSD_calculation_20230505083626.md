The stiffness of the optical trap was determined by the variance of the thermal fluctuations of a trapped bead or droplet that was based on the Equipartition Theorem: $$ K\langle x^2\rangle=k_bT $$, where $$ K $$ is the stiffness constant of the optical trap, $$ x $$ is the displacement of the bead from trap center, $$ k_b $$ is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Variance $$ \langle x^2\rangle $$ is obtained by integrating the PSD of the termal fluctuations
